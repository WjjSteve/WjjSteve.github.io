I'm a PhD student in Scientific Computing at Uppsala University, Sweden. I am fortunate to be supervised by [Prof.Murtazo Nazarov](https://www.uu.se/kontakt-och-organisation/personal?query=N14-1561) from Uppsala University and [Prof.Katharina Kormann](https://math.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en/faculty/professorships/numerics/kormann-group/team/prof-dr-katharina-kormann/) from Ruhr University Bo­chum.

The goal of my PhD project is to develop a structure-preserving finite element discretization for high-dimensional Vlasov--Maxwell equations. We are interested in preserving  the basic physical properties of Vlasov--Maxwell equations such as the positivity of the plasma distribution function, and improve the computation performance of our solver using low-rank tensors.
The project is carried out in cooperation with the Ruhr University Bochum, Germany, and I visit Bochum several times during the course of the project.


Before starting my PhD, I earned an M.Sc. in Computational Science from Uppsala University (2021–2023). Earlier, I completed my B.Sc. in Civil Engineering at Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China (2017–2021).
