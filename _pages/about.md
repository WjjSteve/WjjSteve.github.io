I'm a PhD student in Scientific Computing at Uppsala University, Sweden. I am fortunate to be supervised by [Prof.Murtazo Nazarov](https://www.uu.se/kontakt-och-organisation/personal?query=N14-1561) from Uppsala University and [Prof.Katharina Kormann](https://math.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en/faculty/professorships/numerics/kormann-group/team/prof-dr-katharina-kormann/) from Ruhr University Bo­chum.

My PhD research focuses on developing structure-preserving finite element discretizations for high-dimensional Vlasov–Maxwell equations. We aim to preserve fundamental physical properties of the system—such as the positivity of the plasma distribution function—while also improving computational performance through the use of low-rank tensor techniques.

The project is carried out in collaboration with Ruhr University Bochum in Germany, and I regularly visit Bochum throughout the course of the research.

Before starting my PhD, I earned an M.Sc. in Computational Science from Uppsala University (2021–2023). Earlier, I completed my B.Sc. in Civil Engineering at Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China (2017–2021).
